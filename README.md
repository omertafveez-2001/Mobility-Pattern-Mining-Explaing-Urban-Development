# About Project
The purpose of this project was to investigate underlying patterns from the dataset of GPS Trajectory downloaded from Microsoft.

<br>
The project explores the EDA processes obtained from the dataset and uses statistical inferences to explain Urban Development using 2 regression models.
<br>
The project is an extension to mobility pattern mining and just a tip of an iceberg of how pattern mining from granular datasets can be used to explain phenomenon not clearly explained within the dataset.
